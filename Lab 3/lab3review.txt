Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  Select *
  From Products
  Where city NOT in ('Dallas' , 'Duluth') AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


2. List the name and city of agents named Smith.

Incorrect output
- You are giving all fields, which is incorrect, you were asked to give
  [name,city]



In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable, I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab3.sql

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.
