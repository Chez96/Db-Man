4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

through agent a07 in pid order from highest to lowest.

  it again, please.


7. Get all customers who have the same discount as that of any customers in
Dallas or London

  it again, please. Why New York?


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- Your definition of a check constraint is wrong. 


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.
