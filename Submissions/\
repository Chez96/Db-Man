Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth' AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;

In general: 

- Be careful with the way you are using parenthesis. They were not
strictly necessary for this lab. Use them only if necessary or if it helps with
the organization of the SQL statement.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable, I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab3.sql

- Make sure you use the correct dash character! There was an error:
ERROR:  syntax error at or near "—"
LINE 1:  —-Artur Barbosa —-Feb 10th, 2016 —-Lab3 select ordno, dolla...
         ^

- Make sure you use the correct single quote character! This ' instead of 
  this ’. There was an error:
ERROR:  unterminated quoted string at or near "'feb’"
LINE 1: ...ROM Orders WHERE Orders.dollars < 500 AND Orders.mon = 'feb’

- You submitted queries compatible with the other group's database, with Alan's
  section. So, I am going to investigate this further. If I determine you are
  cheating, you will receive a failing grade in this assignment.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.

- You submitted a .rtf file, which is not a text file. I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab3.sql
